### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd smart-contracts-hardhat
npm install
```

### Start the Local Blockchain:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

#### Create Environment Variable File

Create `.env` file inside the smart-contracts-hardhat directory.

**Production Deployment Network Variables**
These variables are used to deploy the project voting smart contract to the blockchain. Both these variables are only required for production deploy. You should keep these private, especially the private key.

- `PRIVATE_KEY` Wallet private key for deploy
- `SEPOLIA_URL` RPC test node url for deploy
- `ETHERIUM_URL` RPC production node url for deploy
- `ARWEAVE_WALLET_ADDRESS` Arweave wallet address to retrieve project markdown files.
- `ARWEAVE_TAG_PROJECT_FILE_VERSION` Arweave tag to retrieve project files by version.

**Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF) Variables**
These variables are public ids that are used to reference a VRF instance. These are required for choosing the winner when the prize pool reaches the threshold in the project voting smart contract.

You can readmore about VRF on their [official documentation](https://docs.chain.link/vrf).

- VRF_KEY_HASH
- VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
- VRF_COORDINATOR_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA

#### TODO: Setup CCIP local simulator

The CCIP local simular allows us to run Chainlink services locally for development purposes. This project utilizes Chainlink VRF to create verifiable randomness on the blockchain.

#### Deploy the Project Voting Smart Contract Localy Using Hardhat Ignition

This command will use the hardhat ignition script to deploy a local version of the smart contract on the hardhat node. The script does the following tasks:

1. Deploys the smart contract.
2. Retrieves project transaction ids and data from Arweave. The script uses the Arweave wallet address environment variable to find the project files. Also, a project version tag is used to retrieve the correct file type (this is nessisary because I'm iterating on the markdown format to eventually move to using MDX).
3. Create a project on the smart contract for each Arweave project.

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/ProjectVoting.ts --network localhost --reset
```

**Output:**

```bash
âœ” Confirm deploy to network localhost (1337)? â€¦ yes
âœ” Confirm reset of deployment "chain-1337" on chain 1337? â€¦ yes

Take note of the smart contract address `0x68B1D87F95878fE05B998F19b66F4baba5De1aed`.

#### Initialize and Apply Projects to the Blockchain:

Run the initialization script to add new projects to the local blockchain. You can then see these projects on the `/projects` page.

```bash

npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/create-projects.js
```

#### TODO: Test Scripts

There is a test script for the project voting smart contract and all should pass before proceeding.

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

#### TODO: The Graph Subgraph Integration

I plan on updating this project to utilize the [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) which is a blockchain indexer for efficient data querying. This project currently interacts directly with the RPC layer through the injected `ethereum provider` of the browser.

#### TODO: Arweave Integration

I plan on changing the content source of my project from local files stored on the repository to files stored on [Arweave](https://arweave.org/build) to futher decentralize my project. These assets will be pulled from arweave at build time to staticaly generate pages. This will make page load times fast and prevent needing to access arweave for every page load. A link to the original file will be provided on the static page for cross-reference.

_The point of storing the projects on Arweave is to have a permanent reference to their existence (immutibility). Each file stored on Arweave is writen in markdown and all images referenced within are links to image files also stored on Arweave. This is crutial to insure that there is always a reference to the file in a specific state to insure transparency in the voting process. This is a demonstration of how democratic voting would work on the blockchain using smart contracts and decentralized storage solutions._
